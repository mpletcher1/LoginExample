Black box the feature

Implement middleware, in form of separate project
Dll that can be plugged into app
Httpmodule -> loginmodule
Provide login url to intercept and analyze requests
Intercept back, and in config file have token retrieval URL

Separate DLL that can integrate into app and integrate intoo web.config to see if requests match login-specific URLs

	• Json attribute to convert the name to 
	
Create browser token in response header for 


Implement HTTP module ->> middleware
	- Purpose is intercepting calls and analyzing for login, security, authorization token
	- Request analyzer class, can be an extension
		○ Request.isTokenRequest, request.isLoginRequest
			§ Login.Process, etc
			§ If is virtual token request -> process and put in response
		○ Actual application code should have nothing to do with this stuff
		○ Should only extract token info -> description in README file
	- Has to work for WebForms and MVC buut wont work for ..NET core
		○ How to implement middleware for .NET core - google this
			§ Can it be done via web.config?


	1. All code - create utilities in separate project, try to call from main proj
	2. Try with InitialRespoonseToken 
	3. In other project, implement HTTPmodule
		a. Request analyzer
			i. If request is login, use loginProcessor


Create Project with features that accept requests
	- Uusing request information will extract required argument and make web api call
	- Separate DLL/project for these features for .NET CORE
		
	- ..NET framework will use HTTP module with common DLL
	- Abstract the HTTP client 
		○ Request Executor
	- Static utility classes
	- Static resources class (internal)
